# Level Progression

~22 levels in five worlds. Each level lists: the lesson, the obstacle, and the new
real material it introduces. Optimization re-play is expected; pars per metric.

Bodies introduced along the way (performance profiles are level data):
- **AX-01 "Mule"** — forgiving trainer: wide envelope, instant approvals, no quirks.
- **AX-02 "Heron"** — endurance platform: slow, low ceiling, miserly fuel model,
  FA answers control requests with PENDING for several ticks first.
- **AX-03 "Ferret"** — agile: tight turn limits at low speed, no Curve Following
  capability advertised, flinchy collision-avoidance FA.
- **AX-04 "Boxkite"** — world-4 oddball: VI OMS Isolator modeled as a distinct
  filtering/latency stage; strict heartbeat discipline.

## World 0 — Listen Before You Speak (2 levels)

- **0.1 First Contact.** No commands available. Goal: light a panel lamp when
  `SubsystemStatusMT` arrives and keep it lit (it doubles as FA's heartbeat — real
  semantics). Teaches: the message log, triggers, the idea that FA talks first.
- **0.2 Spec Sheet.** Goal: read the body's `MA_FlightCapabilityMT` and set output
  registers: which control modes are advertised? what is MaxAltitude? Teaches:
  the performance profile is data on the bus, not a manual page.

## World 1 — HSA/CSA (7 levels, body AX-01 then AX-02)

- **1.1 Handshake.** Acquire HSA capability control: wait for
  `MA_FlightCapabilityStatusMT` AVAILABLE → `MA_ControlRequestMT` (ACQUIRE, correct
  CapabilityID) → handle APPROVED → confirm via next `ControlStatusMT` showing you
  as SecondaryController. Win: hold secondary control 30 ticks. The level's bait:
  sending `MA_FlightCommandMT` first — FA silently drops it (it isn't listening),
  and the log shows why.
- **1.2 First Valid HSA Command.** Fly heading 270° at 3 000 m to a zone. Full
  cycle: command → ACCEPTED → consume `MA_FlightActivityMT` and
  `MA_PositionReportDetailedMT` to detect arrival (HSA has no completion state —
  real semantics; *you* must notice you've arrived). **← MVP level.**
- **1.3 Envelope.** Objective zone sits above this body's MaxAltitude... or does
  it? The profile republishes as fuel burns off and the ceiling rises. Naive
  command → `PERFORMANCE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`. Par (0 rejections) requires reading
  `HSA_CSA_PerformanceProfile` and clamping/waiting. Teaches: rejection enum +
  envelope-as-data.
- **1.4 Racetrack by Hand.** Fly a hold pattern using only HSA. Teaches partial
  commands: update *only* `Direction` each leg (bus-traffic par is unreachable if
  you resend full commands), `CommandState` UPDATE vs NEW.
- **1.5 Winds Aloft.** Reach a narrow corridor in a stiff crosswind read from
  `WeatherObservationMT`. Heading (HSA) vs course (CSA, `Course` field) — command
  course or compute your own crab angle. Teaches: H vs C is not pedantry.
- **1.6 Bingo.** Distant zone, thin fuel. `NavigationReportMT` (fuel mass/percent/
  duration) + `SpeedOptimizationEnum` MAX_ENDURANCE vs explicit speed. Greedy max
  cruise → `VIOLATION_ENDURANCE` rejection. Teaches: FA validates against
  endurance, and speed can be delegated.
- **1.7 Counter-Offer.** Mission parameters FA won't accept as-asked; FA rejects
  *with a best-effort `MA_TaskMT`* (Flight field). Brain must read the suggested
  parameters and resend. Teaches: rejection is the start of a negotiation, not a
  dead end.

## World 2 — Waypoint Following (6 levels, bodies AX-01/AX-02)

- **2.1 The Upload Liturgy.** A route is given; getting FA to fly it is the puzzle:
  `MA_MissionPlanActivationCommandMT` PREPARE_FOR_UPLOAD → COMPLETED → publish
  `MA_RoutePlanMT` → `MA_SystemNotificationMT` CONFIRMED → UPLOAD → COMPLETED →
  prepare-for-activation → READY_FOR_ACTIVATION → ACTIVATE → route executes.
  Skipping or reordering any step fails with the real status semantics. This level
  is unapologetically the route-plan state machine, and it becomes the player's
  first big reusable interaction block.
- **2.2 Threading the Fence.** Build the route's waypoints yourself around
  geozones. Lazy straight line → `VIOLATION_GEOFENCE` (with the offending segment
  identified, per `RouteValidationInvalidPathType`). Optional pre-check via
  Validate Route Plan (`RoutePlanValidationCommandMT`) — costs messages, saves
  rejections; the metrics trade off against each other.
- **2.3 On Station.** Loiter on a fix: Racetrack with the real defaults (right
  turns; 60 s legs at/below 14 000 ft MSL, 90 s above). Par requires letting the
  defaults work for you instead of over-specifying. Teaches loiter types +
  `MA_FixOrbitType` refinement.
- **2.4 Read-Only.** Weather closes the objective; divert and land. You cannot
  upload an approach route — takeoff/departure/approach/landing plans are
  pre-stored on FA, safety-critical, read-only (real rule). Query them
  (`QueryDataRequestMT` → `MA_RoutePlanMT` + `AirfieldReportMT`) and activate by
  reference. Teaches: the Airworthiness Boundary as a gameplay wall.
- **2.5 Retask.** Mid-route, the objective moves. DEACTIVATE on an EXECUTING route
  returns FAILED (real); the correct move is superseding with a new flight command
  or activating a replacement route. Teaches: supersede vs deactivate semantics.
- **2.6 FA Says No.** Pop-up restricted zone: FA aborts your active route itself
  (VI Deactivate Route; `RoutePlanExecutionStatusMT` CANCELED). Brain must detect
  the cancel, fall back to an HSA hold (block reuse from world 1!), and re-plan.
  First robustness exam.

## World 3 — Curve Following (4 levels, body AX-03 — which advertises Curve on
this variant; its sister variant in world 4 doesn't)

- **3.1 First Curve.** One quintic Bézier segment (six control points, ownship NED
  reference) through two gates. Teaches the curve command payload; knot vector and
  weights shown read-only.
- **3.2 Canyon.** Multi-segment (≤10) curve through terrain. Over-tight curvature →
  `PERFORMANCE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` or `INVALID_CURVE` with the offending section
  (`MA_CurveSectionType` start/end parameter + segment number); terrain clips →
  `VIOLATION_TERRAIN`. Teaches: control-point geometry vs the acceleration limits
  in `CurveFollowingPerformanceProfile`.
- **3.3 Append.** Continuous show-line: keep appending segments with `AppendCurve`
  *while executing* (only valid then — real rule); a gap in the pipeline means the
  vehicle hits `EndOfCurveBehavior` and loiters, blowing the time par.
- **3.4 Exit Strategy.** Same course, two scored variants: end in a circular
  loiter at the endpoint vs continue at previous CSA (`EndOfCurveBehaviorEnum`),
  plus a timing window via `MA_CurveTraversingType`. Teaches: you choose what
  happens after the curve, and FA holds you to it.

## World 4 — Brain Swap (5 levels)

- **4.1 Second Body.** Re-fly 1.4's hold + 2.3's station with your existing brains
  on AX-02: lower ceiling, PENDING before APPROVED, slower turn rate. A brain that
  hardcoded altitudes/speeds gets `PERFORMANCE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`; one that read the
  profile mostly just works. Edits allowed but counted ("diff size" bonus metric).
- **4.2 The Flinch.** AX-03 with an anxious FA: frequent collision-avoidance
  interrupts (`CONSTRAINT_COLLISION_AVOIDANCE`, capabilities TEMPORARILY_UNAVAILABLE,
  resume signaled by fresh `MA_FlightCapabilityMT`). Brain must hold state, not
  spam, and resume cleanly. Also: it advertises *no* Curve Following — a brain that
  assumes the mode meets `CAPABILITY_NOT_SUPPORTED`.
- **4.3 Degraded.** Mid-mission `MA_FaultMT` (CAUTION, then WARNING) and a
  tightened republished envelope. The mission is still completable inside the new
  numbers. Final exam in consuming status: the brain that re-reads
  `MA_FlightCapabilityMT` after a fault passes; the one that cached it at boot
  doesn't.
- **4.4 Heartbeat Discipline.** AX-04 (isolator modeled): the brain must publish
  `ServiceStatusMT` every N ticks; on missed FA heartbeats it must issue
  `SubsystemStatusDataRequestMT` before assuming failure (real comms-failure
  interaction). Mishandling earns revocation: `MA_ControlRequestStatusMT` CANCELED
  + `MA_ControlAssignmentMT` listing your remaining capabilities (none).
- **4.5 Type Certificate (capstone).** One brain, locked: it flies the same
  mission on AX-01, AX-02, AX-03 back-to-back with zero edits. Score = worst of
  the three runs. Score screen styled as a compliance test report.

## Stretch levels (post-1.0 candidates)

- **Failsafe** (MA Failsafe, 1.2.1.3): designate a recovery plan via
  `MA_ResponseMT` before FA will tolerate risky tasking.
- **QNH** (Receive Barometric Pressure): one-screen settings puzzle.
- **Open FA**: sandbox where the player inspects the FA-side validator config of
  each body — the "read the other side's state machine" reward.
